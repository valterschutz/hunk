# Keybindings

Every keyboard shortcut is a named command, and the `[keybindings]` table maps
command ids to the keys you want them on:

```toml
[keybindings]
"hunk.app.quit" = "ctrl+x"               # one chord
"hunk.review.nextHunk" = ["]", "ctrl+n"] # several chords for one command
"hunk.review.focusFilter" = "/"          # takes "/" back from content search
"hunk.view.toggleMenuBar" = false        # unbind it entirely
"myext.toggle" = "ctrl+g"                # extension commands too
```

Every id starts with the name of whoever owns the command: Hunk's own commands
live under `hunk.`, and an extension's live under its extension id. That split
is structural — `hunk` is a reserved extension id, so an extension can never
mint a command id that shadows a built-in, whatever Hunk adds later. Extension commands currently
run on review surfaces; history resolves its built-in command set without claiming review-only extension chords.

Rules worth knowing:

- **User bindings replace defaults.** Listing chords for a command is the
  complete set of keys it answers to, not an addition to the shipped ones.
- **A key you bind is yours.** Any command that held the same chord only as a
  default gives it up, keeping its other keys. Above, `hunk.search.find` hands
  `/` to the filter while `n` / `N` still step search matches.
- **`false` (or `[]`) unbinds a command**, leaving its keys doing nothing.
- **Unbound commands are one line away.** The file filter ships without a key
  (Tab and the File menu reach it), as do `hunk.review.nextNote` /
  `previousNote` (`}` / `{` step through annotated hunks); one `[keybindings]`
  line gives any of them a chord.
- Two entries claiming one chord is a conflict: the first in the file wins and
  the session reports the other. Unknown command ids and unusable chords are
  reported the same way, and the rest of the table still applies.
- **Escape clears an active visual selection contextually** after overlays and
  extension modes have had their normal ownership. Without a selection, Escape
  remains available to extension commands because clear-selection is unbound.

Chords are `ctrl`, `alt`/`option`, `cmd`/`meta`, and `shift` joined with `+`
around a base key: a character (`"y"`, `"["`), an uppercase letter for its
shifted form (`"G"`), or a named key (`"tab"`, `"pageup"`, `"left"`, `"f2"`).
`shift` applies to letters and named keys only — for a shifted symbol or digit,
write the character the shift produces (`"!"`, not `"shift+1"`), since that is
what terminals report. `ctrl+<letter>` also matches an unnamed bare control
byte; named Tab and Enter events stay distinct. `alt`/`option` matches both
explicit Alt events and the Escape-prefixed form used by legacy terminals. A
legacy terminal cannot distinguish Alt from Meta, so `alt+n` and `meta+n` may
overlap there; Kitty keyboard events keep them distinct.

Inline saved notes also expose clickable **Edit**, **Reply**, and (for reply-free user notes)
**Delete** actions. `E` edits the first editable user note in the selected hunk and `R` replies
to its first visible stored note. Replies inherit the code anchor and may be nested without a
product depth limit. Static sidecar annotations are not reply targets, and a parent cannot be
deleted until its replies are removed.

The built-in commands and the keys they ship with:

On a terminal, `hunk log` opens its read-only history browser automatically. Its `hunk.history.*`
commands use the same configurable keybinding resolver as review while retaining history-specific effects.
Shared application commands such as `hunk.app.quit`, `hunk.app.toggleHelp`, and
`hunk.view.openThemeSelector` keep the same ids on both surfaces. `F10` opens File, View, Navigate, Commit, and Help menus;
View includes Hunk's shared theme selector and an optional **Graph view** that replaces the default
day-grouped timeline with commit-topology lanes. It uses `Up`/`Down` or `j`/`k` to move; press `v` first to
extend a contiguous commit selection with those same keys. `Shift+Up`/`Shift+Down` or uppercase `K`/`J` extend
directly, and `Escape` collapses the selection. `PageUp`/`PageDown`, `b`/`f`, or `Shift+Space`/`Space` page
through history; `u`/`d` or `Ctrl-U`/`Ctrl-D` move by half a page; `g`/`G` or `Home`/`End` jump,
`/` to search, `n`/`N` for matches, `t` to choose a theme, `r` to refresh, `y` to copy the focused commit's full id,
`Enter` to open the selection in normal Hunk review, and `q` or `Ctrl-C` to quit. With a mouse, Shift-click a row to extend the
selection when the terminal forwards modifiers, click a commit id to open it immediately, click the adjacent copy
icon to copy its full immutable id, click elsewhere on a row to select it, or double-click a row to open it.
Range selection is unavailable with `--all` or author, message, date, and path filters because those traversals
can interleave unrelated commits or hide intermediate commits. Quitting the opened review returns to the retained history selection and viewport. The Commit menu's
**Compare with first parent** and **Compare with parent…** actions compare the selected commit against
an ordered provider-owned parent; they do not navigate the history selection to that parent.

The files-pane command follows the named `hunk:files` role. If an extension
replaces that role, the command and **View → Files pane** toggle the resolved
replacement on any terminal edge without changing unrelated panes. Remapping or
unbinding `hunk.view.toggleFilesPane` changes that role-aware action, not an
extension pane's own commands. The former `hunk.view.toggleSidebar` id remains a
compatibility alias; prefer the files-pane name in new config and extension
code. Likewise, `hunk.view.layoutStack` remains a deprecated alias for
`hunk.view.layoutUnified`, so existing keybindings and extension command calls
continue to select the canonical unified layout.

Commands marked _(none)_ ship without a key: they remain callable by command id
and can be assigned a shortcut through `[keybindings]`. Some also appear in a
menu, while semantic commands such as current-line alignment do not need a menu
entry.

The menus and the controls help dialog (`?`) show the keys for the commands they
present, so remapping something changes what they advertise. Unbinding a menu
command keeps its menu item and simply stops showing a key.

Extension commands are named `<extensionId>.<commandId>` and remap the same way
(see [docs/extensions.md](extensions.md)). An explicitly activated extension
keyboard mode is a routing layer rather than a second command table: it may
consume a key, pass it to these resolved bindings, or consume it and exit. Its
multi-key grammar and counts are extension-owned, but resolved actions should
invoke these same public `hunk.*` commands.

Routing precedence is host prompts and dialogs, menus/overlays, focused text
inputs, an interactive file-view mode, a session extension keyboard mode, then
the command table and focused review widget. Keys that belong to a dialog,
menu, or focused text input — `Esc`, `Enter`, `Ctrl-S` while writing a note —
are part of those widgets rather than commands, and are not remappable. Escape
is also the reserved exit from each active extension mode, so an extension
cannot trap the keyboard.

`[keybindings]` is read from your user config only — never from a repository's
`.hunk/config.toml`. Which keys do what is a property of your keyboard and your
habits, so a checkout you review cannot rearrange them.
