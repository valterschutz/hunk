/**
 * Answering brokered review commands from the session that owns the review.
 *
 * The daemon brokers two review commands to a live session: read one bounded slice of a
 * published resource, and apply one semantic action. Both are answered here, at the seam
 * between the wire schema (`packages/hunk/src/session/reviewProtocol.ts`) and the producer that owns
 * the generation (`packages/hunk/src/app/review/producer.ts`), so neither of those has to know about
 * the other's concerns.
 *
 * Three rules shape it:
 *
 * - **One ordering call.** Whether a caller is acting on the review that exists is
 *   answered by `classifyReviewPublication`, not by comparing revisions here
 *   (`docs/browser-review-seam-audit.md`, C1).
 * - **No re-derivation.** A caller addressing a line inside an expanded gap sends the
 *   proof it holds; core resolves it (`resolveReviewExpandedLine`) and the shared anchor
 *   path places the note. Nothing here computes a hunk intersection or an owner, which is
 *   what the prototype's copy got wrong by dropping the fallback branch (D3).
 * - **Facts stay caller-owned.** Core refuses to invent identity or time, and the host is
 *   the caller here, so note and draft ids and timestamps are allocated at this edge.
