/**
 * The public contract behind `hunkdiff/extension`.
 *
 * This module imports nothing on purpose. Whole-program declaration emission
 * ships every file the entry point reaches, so any import here would publish a
 * slice of Hunk's internals — Pierre's diff types, the git/jj/sl backends —
 * into the package an extension author typechecks against. Keeping the contract
 * self-contained keeps the shipped `.d.ts` tree to this file and its barrel.
 *
 * Shapes internal code genuinely shares with extensions (agent sidecar records,
 * theme config tables) are declared here once and re-exported from their
 * internal homes, so there is still one definition per concept. Shapes that
 * cannot be shared because they reference the diff engine (`DiffFile`,
 * `VcsAdapter`) get a purpose-built public view here, narrow enough that the
 * host can accept it wherever it accepts the internal type.

 * reload it. A revision show, a stash show, a range diff, a staged diff, patch
 * input, and a file-pair diff have no working-tree document to replace, and
 * every write against them resolves `"unavailable"`; so does a session whose
 * review cannot be rebuilt after a write, which is one started with
 * `--agent-context -`, since the reload every write promises could not happen.
 * A file with no new side (deleted) and a file Hunk never read as text (binary,

   * Declining, or pressing Escape, resolves `{ ok: false, reason: "cancelled" }`:
   * a normal answer, never an exception.

   * directory link leading out of the repository, resolves `"unavailable"`
   * without asking, and so does one that has left the working tree since the
   * review was built — a write recreates nothing the user deleted. Hunk checks
   * again after consent, refusing a target deleted or replaced by an unsafe
   * path while the prompt was open.
   *
   * On success Hunk reloads the session the same way the refresh key does, so

   * irreversible write starts, the promise reports its actual outcome even if
   * another reload wins meanwhile, and success reconciles the review then active.
   * Graceful shutdown waits for a started write to settle. The promise settles
   * on the write itself, not on its follow-up reload — a handler that
   * resumes immediately is looking at the changeset it was called with.

   * A filesystem that refuses the write resolves `"failed"` with a
   * human-readable `detail`. The promise **rejects** only for a malformed
   * request — a missing or non-string `fileId` or `text` — which is a bug in
   * the extension rather than an answer, and surfaces through the same warning
