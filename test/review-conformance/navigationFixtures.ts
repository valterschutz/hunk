/**
 * The navigation half of the golden corpus.
 *
 * These fixtures pin what the shared walk answers: where a repeated annotated step lands,
 * which scopes wrap and which stop, what a selection means once its file is filtered away
 * or gone, and which line a reveal scrolls to. Every expectation is written by hand from
 * the semantics — the audit's B-findings are exactly the cases the old per-consumer copies
 * disagreed about, so a captured expectation would preserve the disagreement.
