title: Extension API
description: Register CLI commands, themes, file previews, keyboard modes, transforms, dialogs, and events through the extension API object.
---

The extension factory receives one API object. Registration calls are only valid while the factory is running; Hunk seals the object afterwards so a deferred callback cannot mutate the registry mid-session. This page indexes the whole object; larger registration calls are documented in depth on their own pages and summarized in place below.

## `hunk.apiVersion`

The API generation this Hunk speaks (currently `28`). Branch on it if you want
one file to support several Hunk versions. Version 28 adds host-owned syntax highlighting for file-view code documents; version 27 adds `ctx.selection.files`, the visible files in review order; version 26 adds the status line (`ctx.statusLine` items and `ctx.prompts.line()` inline prompts); version 25 adds Promise-returning watch signatures and watch cancellation; version 24 adds review metadata to VCS patch results and short display revisions to commit descriptors; version 23 adds canonical unified-layout fields while preserving the previous event vocabulary; version 22 adds frame-derived pane preferred sizing, non-resizable dynamic panes, and commit-history paint tokens; version 21 adds optional inclusive history-range review
planning and bounded comparison commit summaries; version 20 adds optional commit timestamps to review
metadata, pane clipboard actions, and the `theme.copyAction` paint token; version 19 adds provider-owned history enumeration and review planning; version 18 lets
lifecycle and custom-event handlers request a host-owned review reload; version 17 adds structured review metadata to delegated
patch commands and projects it into pane availability and component props; version 16 adds pane-wide
`onActivate`; version 15 added `{ side, line }` to opted-in pane `currentLine`
paint; version 14 added structured two-revision
VCS diff endpoints; version 13 added saved-note parent identities
and committed note-edit events; version 12 added responsive fractional pane
sizing; version 11 added the `dim` line-highlight tone; version 10 added
generic top-level CLI commands; version 9
added exact-filename and glob selectors to `registerFileLanguage`; version 8
added authoritative review snapshots to command handlers; version 7 added the
current source line to command selection snapshots. Version 6 added session
behavior, terminal-command observation, and live navigation/dialogs in lifecycle
and bus handlers; version 5 added line highlighters and line-granular navigation
(`revealLine`); version 4 added keyboard modes and docked panes, with API-v3
sidebar names remaining as deprecated aliases.

## `hunk.registerCliCommand(command, handler)`

Register a generic top-level command tree. The extension owns every raw token
below its lowercase-kebab top-level name:

```ts
hunk.registerCliCommand(
  { name: "greptile", summary: "Work with Greptile", usage: "<sync|review>" },
  async (args, ctx) => {
    if (args[0] === "sync") {
      await ctx.stdout.write("Synced.\n");
      return { kind: "exit" };
    }
    await ctx.stderr.write("Preparing review…\n");
    return {
      kind: "delegate",
      argv: ["patch", "review.diff"],
      review: {
        kind: "change-request",
        provider: "GitHub",
        title: "Add structured review metadata",
        url: "https://github.com/acme/project/pull/123",
        id: "#123",
        repository: "acme/project",
        author: "octocat",
        base: "main",
        head: "review-metadata",
        state: "open",
        draft: false,
      },
    };
  },
);
```

Handlers receive `ctx.cwd`, cooperative `ctx.signal`, streaming `ctx.stdin`,
and leased, backpressure-aware stdout/stderr writers. They may access networks,
services, processes, and files. Return a validated exit status or delegate once
to a built-in Hunk command. A delegated `patch` command may also carry a provider-neutral
`review` descriptor whose exact shape is `change-request`, `commit`, or `comparison`. Hunk bounds
all strings and the 4 KiB payload, rejects control characters, unknown fields, and unsafe URLs,
then copies and freezes it. `provider` and change-request `id` allow 256 bytes; `repository`,
`author`, `base`, `head`, and `revision` allow 512; `authoredAt` allows 128; `title` and `url`
allow 2 KiB. Change requests may also carry `state` (`open`, `closed`, or `merged`) and boolean
`draft`; commits may carry a parseable `authoredAt` date-time. The descriptor remains app-bootstrap metadata rather than entering
changeset transforms or `ReviewDocumentV1`; same-file refreshes preserve it, while unrelated
reloads clear it. Commits opened from interactive `hunk log` receive the same metadata shape and
retain it while refreshing the exact provider review request. Live-session list, context, and review
JSON snapshots project the same optional bounded descriptor without granting provider or
remote-reload capabilities. Exit results and
non-`patch` delegation cannot carry one.

Delegation cannot follow stdout output or any stdin read, target another extension command, or
change extension bootstrap flags. Built-ins and aliases cannot be shadowed; the first extension
claim in discovery order wins.

Use a leading explicit path while developing:

```bash
hunk --extension ./greptile.ts greptile sync
```

Bare help remains static; `hunk greptile --help` passes `--help` to the handler.

`summary` and `usage` surface when a top-level token reaches extension
discovery unclaimed. That failure lists every loaded command instead of only
naming the bad token, so keep both to one short line:

```text
hunk: Unknown command: nosuchthing

Extension commands available here:
hunk gh <number|owner/repo#number|pull-request-url> [--repo <owner/repo>] — Review a GitHub pull request
```

For a complete implementation, see the dependency-free
[`github-pr` example](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/tree/main/examples/extensions/github-pr).
It fetches GitHub PR diffs directly, delegates a temporary patch with
restrictive POSIX modes (and inherited temporary-directory ACLs on Windows)
into Hunk, and cleans the patch up on shutdown:

```bash
hunk --extension ./examples/extensions/github-pr gh 123
```

## `hunk.configureSession(options)`

Request host behavior for the review session loading the extension. Training,
demo, and presentation extensions can make their view-setting changes temporary:

```ts
hunk.configureSession({ viewPreferences: "transient" });
```

If any loaded extension requests this, Hunk skips the save-view-preferences
prompt on quit instead of offering to write practice state into user config.
The default is `"default"`.

## `hunk.registerTheme(theme)`

Contribute one selectable theme. The object is the same shape as a `[themes.<id>]` config table:

```ts
hunk.registerTheme({
  id: "midnight-review",
  label: "Midnight Review",
  base: "catppuccin-mocha",
  accent: "#7fd1ff",
  syntaxScopes: { "keyword.operator": "#7fd1ff" },
});
```

Theme ids are lowercase words separated by `-` or `_` and cannot reuse a built-in id. Config-defined themes win over extension themes for the same id. Extension themes appear in the selector after config themes, in load order.

## `hunk.registerFileLanguage(matcher, language)`

Map an extension, exact filename, or glob to an existing syntax-highlighting language. A string remains shorthand for a case-insensitive extension; object-form extension values receive the same trimming, leading-dot removal, and lowercasing:

```ts
hunk.registerFileLanguage(".zig", "zig");
hunk.registerFileLanguage({ kind: "filename", value: "BUILD" }, "python");
hunk.registerFileLanguage(
  { kind: "glob", value: "generated/**/*.proto", target: "path" },
  "protobuf",
);
```

Filename and glob matching is case-sensitive. Filename selectors match at any directory depth; globs explicitly target the basename or review path exactly as decoded. `/` is the path separator, backslashes stay literal, and filename/glob whitespace is preserved. Globs reject NUL and skip NUL-bearing decoded patch paths; exact filenames can still match them. VCS review paths are normally repo-relative, while generic patches may carry absolute paths. Hunk's reserved `.mts` and `.cts` mappings run first and cannot be overridden. Otherwise, exact filenames take precedence over globs, then extensions. Later registrations win ties.

This selects a grammar already available to Pierre/Shiki; it does not load a new syntax grammar.

## `hunk.registerVcsAdapter(adapter)`

Contribute an additional version-control backend — the same call Hunk's own bundled Git, Jujutsu, and Sapling backends make. An adapter declares `detect`, its `operations` (`working-tree-diff`, `revision-show`, `stash-show`), and optionally detection priority, watch support, exact file sources, extra files, and rich user-fixable failures.

Full contract: [VCS adapters](/docs/extend/vcs-adapters/).

## `hunk.registerPane(pane)`

Render a React component on the `left`, `right`, `top`, or `bottom` of the review. Panes receive their dimensions, review state, actions, keybindings, and optional current-line paint (including `{ side, line }` when opted in). `props.review`, `available(context).review`, and `preferredSize(context).review` expose immutable metadata from a delegated patch command or interactive history selection, or `null` for ordinary reviews. `preferredSize` derives an automatic whole-cell target within the registered bounds; a manual divider drag takes precedence unless `resizable: false` suppresses that divider. `registerSidebarView` remains a deprecated alias.

Full contract: [Custom panes](/docs/extend/custom-sidebars/).

## `hunk.registerFileView(view)`

Contribute an opt-in alternate presentation for matching files. A view receives the public file and hunk model, typed change ranges, terminal width, cancellation, and lazy exact-source reads. It returns deterministic symbolic rows, optional fixed-height React/OpenTUI row painters, source bindings for inline notes, and positional hunk extents.

Raw diff remains the default and fallback. Hunk continues to own review-stream geometry, scrolling, windowing, hunk navigation, selection, and note rendering.

Full contract and examples: [File previews](/docs/extend/file-previews/).

## `hunk.registerLineHighlighter(highlighter)`

Mark character ranges inside Hunk's own diff rendering — search hits, diagnostics, secret scanning, coverage — without replacing the file's presentation. Syntax highlighting, word diff, and layout stay intact; the marked characters get a resolved background.

```ts
hunk.registerLineHighlighter({
  id: "todos",
  highlight({ file }) {
    // Scan file.patch (or a readDocument result) and return marks.
    return [{ side: "new", line: 12, range: [4, 8], tone: "warning" }];
  },
});
```

Marks are addressed by source coordinates — `side`, a 1-based `line`, and a `[start, end)` range in UTF-16 code units of
the raw line text — so they survive split vs unified layout, wrapping, horizontal scrolling, and collapsed-context
expansion. A mark paints terminal columns, so a range covering only zero-width characters (bidi controls, ZWSP) paints
nothing. Tones (`match`, `current`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `dim`) rather than colors: Hunk resolves each tinted tone
against the actual background of each marked line with a minimum-contrast guarantee stronger than its own word-diff
emphasis, so a mark is never invisible on an added line's green; `dim` recedes text toward the background while
preserving token hues for review progress or noise reduction; on a transparent cell the tint is resolved against the
background Hunk assumes rather than the one behind the terminal. `current` renders as reverse video, the `less`/vim
convention for the active hit.

`highlight` may be sync or async and is treated as a pure derivation of the file plus an invalidation epoch: results are cached until `ctx.highlights.refresh("todos")` (optionally `{ fileId }`-scoped) re-derives them. Failures, oversized results, and invalid entries cost that file's marks and nothing else — highlights change colors, never text or geometry.

Full contract: [authoring guide](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/extensions.md#hunkregisterlinehighlighterhighlighter).

## `hunk.transformChangeset(fn)`

Rewrite the loaded changeset before it reaches the review UI. Transforms run in registration order, each seeing the previous one's output, on first load and on every reload.

```ts
hunk.transformChangeset((changeset) => ({
  ...changeset,
  files: changeset.files.filter((file) => !file.path.endsWith(".lock")),
}));
```

The function may be async. Filtering and reordering `files` is fully supported — panes and the review stream follow whatever you return.

Each file carries an opaque `metadata` field — the parsed diff the renderer draws from — so pass it through untouched; spreading a file preserves it. Returns are validated: a transform that throws or returns something the review UI cannot draw is skipped, and the previous changeset carries forward.

You never need `metadata` to know a file's hunks: the read-only views Hunk hands outward (event payloads, pane props, a command's selection) carry a `hunks` list of public summaries — `index`, the `@@` header, and the inclusive old/new line spans, in render order. Like `changeType`, it is derived at that boundary; a transform neither receives nor produces it.

## `hunk.registerKeyboardMode(mode)`

Register a session-wide, deliberately activated keyboard interpretation. Modes receive frozen plain key snapshots after dialogs, menus, focused inputs, and interactive file views, but before Hunk's ordinary command table.

```ts
hunk.registerKeyboardMode({
  id: "normal",
  title: "Vim navigation",
  onKey(key, ctx) {
    if (key.sequence !== "j") return "pass";
    ctx.commands.execute("hunk.review.stepDown");
    return "handled";
  },
});

hunk.registerCommand({ id: "vim", title: "Toggle Vim navigation", key: "ctrl+v" }, (ctx) => {
  if (ctx.keyboardModes.isActive("normal")) ctx.keyboardModes.exitMode();
  else ctx.keyboardModes.enterMode("normal");
});
```

`onKey` returns `"handled"`, `"pass"`, or `"exit"` synchronously. Optional `onEnter`/`onExit` callbacks reset extension-owned state such as counts and pending sequences; while either lifecycle callback runs, `enterMode()` and `exitMode()` return `false`. The context exposes only `cwd`, `notify`, public `commands`, activation-scoped `keyboardModes` controls, and `highlights` refresh controls. Those controls become inert on exit, so retained callbacks cannot replace a later mode. When the session mode is the highest-priority input owner, host-owned Escape exits it; the persistent status badge and Extensions-menu exit are clickable too.

One session mode runs at a time. Entering another runs the outgoing `onExit` first. Focused dialogs and file-view modes temporarily outrank, rather than destroy, a session mode. Content soft reloads preserve it; extension reload, registry closure, and App teardown retire it. See the complete [authoring guide](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/extensions.md#session-keyboard-modes) and [`vim-navigation` example](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/tree/main/examples/extensions/vim-navigation), which includes counts, Ctrl chords, and a focused `:` command line.

## `hunk.registerCommand(command, handler)`

Register a named command, optionally bound to a key. Commands are the same mechanism Hunk's own shortcuts dispatch through — one table, one loop, built-ins first.

```ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "hunkdiff/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.registerCommand({ id: "hello", title: "Say hello", key: "ctrl+g" }, (ctx) => {
    ctx.notify("hello from a command");
  });
}
```

Key chords join `ctrl`, `alt`/`option`, `cmd`/`meta`, and `shift` with `+` around a character or named key. For shifted symbols or digits, bind the resulting character (`"!"`, not `"shift+1"`). `ctrl+<letter>` also matches an unnamed bare control byte; named keys stay distinct. `key` may be a list. Omit it for no binding. Existing bindings keep priority.

Declared keys are defaults: users remap commands by id in their `[keybindings]` table — yours is `"<extensionId>.<commandId>"`. See [`docs/keybindings.md`](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/keybindings.md).

Registered commands are also listed in the menu bar's **Extensions** menu under their `title`, showing whichever key they currently answer to — a command with no binding is still reachable with the mouse.

The handler fires when the key is pressed outside modal UI (dialogs, menus, and focused text inputs own their keys). It receives the standard context plus:

- `ctx.commands.isEnabled(commandId)` / `execute(commandId, { count? })` — probes or invokes an explicitly public built-in `hunk.*` command through the same live table as keyboard and menu actions. Relative movement applies counts atomically; extension-owned and cross-extension commands return `false`.
- `ctx.keyboardModes.enterMode(id)` / `exitMode()` / `isActive(id?)` — controls only keyboard modes registered by this command's owning extension.
- `ctx.panes.open(paneId)` / `close(paneId)` / `toggle(paneId)` / `isOpen(paneId)` — controls your panes by bare id or any pane by its fully qualified `"<extensionId>:<paneId>"` key, including `"hunk:files"`. `ctx.sidebars` is deprecated.
- `ctx.fileViews.select(viewId)` / `toggle(viewId)` / `isActive(viewId)` — controls a matching [file preview](/docs/extend/file-previews/) for the current file; `select(null)` restores raw diff.
- `ctx.fileViews.refresh(viewId, options?)` — marks that view's prepared layouts stale so a stateful view re-derives; every file presenting it re-lays out, keeping its current rows visible until the replacement resolves. Pass `{ fileId }` to scope the invalidation to one reviewed file's presentation of the view.
- `ctx.fileViews.enterMode(viewId)` / `exitMode()` / `isModeActive(viewId)` — starts, stops, or checks an [interactive preview](/docs/extend/file-previews/#interactive-previews). Entering selects the view and returns whether its mode started.
- `ctx.review.snapshot()` — captures stable file identities and every saved note from the authoritative shared ReviewStore.
- `ctx.selection` — where the review was pointing when the command fired.
- `ctx.navigation` — moves the review stream.
- `ctx.dialogs` — asks the user, below.
- `ctx.workspace` — reads reviewed files, and writes one back to the working tree with the user's consent, below.

```ts
hunk.registerCommand(
  { id: "show-selection", title: "Show the selected file", key: "ctrl+y" },
  (ctx) => {
    const { file, hunkIndex } = ctx.selection;
    if (!file) {
      ctx.notify("No file selected");
      return;
    }

    ctx.notify(hunkIndex === null ? file.path : `${file.path} — hunk ${hunkIndex + 1}`);
  },
);
```

`selection.file` is a frozen view, identical to a pane's `files` entries; it is `null` when filtering hides the selected file or when no files are visible. `selection.hunkIndex` is `null` whenever `file` is, or when the file has no hunks. `selection.currentLine` is the one-based `{ side, line }` source address carrying the current-line marker, or `null` when that marker is off or the review has not settled on a rendered line. It belongs to this file and hunk, uses Hunk's canonical new-side address for context rows, and can be passed directly to `navigation.revealLine`. The values are captured when the command fires, so an async handler keeps the selection it started from.

### Authoritative review snapshots

`ctx.review.snapshot()` returns a deeply immutable value, or `null` after the command's review generation expires. It contains the opaque producer `generation`, the shared store's `stateRevision`, every file in authoritative review/sidebar order, and every saved live or reviewer note. File records expose stable `fileKey`, transient navigation `runtimeId`, content identity, status, and paths. Note records preserve their complete old/new anchor and `active`, `stale`, or `orphaned` reconciliation status.

Drafts are not saved and are excluded. Static sidecar annotations that never entered ReviewStore remain on changeset file views rather than in the snapshot. Saved notes are ordered by live arrival and then reviewer creation, including orphaned notes an exporter may need to move into a summary.

For irreversible asynchronous work, capture once, prepare the request, then call `snapshot()` again and compare both `generation` and `stateRevision`. Revisions compare only within one generation. The [`review-snapshot-export` example](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/tree/main/examples/extensions/review-snapshot-export) demonstrates the complete JSON export and stale-work check. The [`review-note-navigator` example](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/tree/main/examples/extensions/review-note-navigator) combines the complete inventory and authoritative anchors with a selector dialog and guarded navigation to currently visible files.

`ctx.navigation.selectFile(fileId)`, `selectHunk(fileId, hunkIndex)`, and `revealLine(fileId, side, line)` route through the same guarded review controller as a pane's `actions` — the stream scrolls, selection updates, `selection_changed` fires. Unlike `selection` it is live: a handler that awaits a dialog and then navigates still works.

`revealLine` is the finest target: a hunk hundreds of lines tall has one anchor, so `selectHunk` can leave the line you meant pages below the viewport. `line` is 1-based on `side` as the patch numbers it, so a context line answers to either side's number. The revealed line lands a little below the viewport top — where every other Hunk reveal lands — and becomes the current line, pairing with a mark from `registerLineHighlighter`. A line no rendered row carries (inside a collapsed gap, absent from a partial patch, or with the current-line marker off) falls back to the hunk containing it; a line no hunk covers, a side outside `"old"`/`"new"`, and a line number that is not a positive whole number are refused with a warning naming the extension.

All built-ins listed in the [keybindings reference](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/keybindings.md) are public to command handlers. This includes the unbound `hunk.review.alignCurrentLineTop`, `hunk.review.alignCurrentLineCenter`, and `hunk.review.alignCurrentLineBottom` commands. `count` defaults to `1`, is capped at `10,000`, and scales relative row, viewport, horizontal, file, hunk, and annotated navigation in one host transition. Absolute and one-shot commands run once. Unknown, disabled, non-public, extension-owned, or stale commands return `false`. `isEnabled` also returns `false` for a malformed id; malformed `execute` ids, options, and counts throw into normal extension failure containment.

A handler may be async; a failure becomes a warning naming your extension.

### Asking the user

`ctx.dialogs` puts a question on screen and waits for the answer. Three methods, all return promises:

- `confirm({ title, body?, confirmLabel?, cancelLabel? })` → `true` or `false`
- `select({ title, options })` → the chosen string, or `null`
- `input({ title, placeholder?, initial? })` → the typed string, or `null`

```ts
hunk.registerCommand(
  { id: "reformat", title: "Reformat the selected file", key: "ctrl+r" },
  async (ctx) => {
    const file = ctx.selection.file;
    if (!file) {
      return;
    }

    const proceed = await ctx.dialogs.confirm({
      title: `Reformat ${file.path}?`,
      body: "The file is rewritten in place.",
      confirmLabel: "reformat",
    });

    ctx.notify(proceed ? `Reformatting ${file.path}` : "Left it alone");
  },
);
```

`select` fits acting on part of the selection — asking which hunk to jump to, then navigating there:

```ts
hunk.registerCommand({ id: "pick-hunk", title: "Pick a hunk", key: "ctrl+k" }, async (ctx) => {
  const file = ctx.selection.file;
  const hunks = file?.hunks ?? [];
  if (!file || hunks.length === 0) {
    ctx.notify("Nothing to pick from", "warning");
    return;
  }

  const labels = hunks.map((hunk) => hunk.header || `hunk ${hunk.index + 1}`);
  const picked = await ctx.dialogs.select({ title: "Which hunk?", options: labels });

  // `navigation` is live, so the jump is valid even after awaiting the dialog.
  if (picked !== null) {
    ctx.navigation.selectHunk(file.id, labels.indexOf(picked));
  }
});
```

Hunk draws the dialog; your text fills the title, body, and choices. Dialogs from installed extensions carry an `ext <your-id>` attribution line — the same marker `notify` toasts use — so a third-party prompt cannot present itself as Hunk asking. Hunk's own bundled extensions omit that redundant marker.

One dialog shows at a time; concurrent requests queue in call order, across extensions. Escape cancels (`false` or `null`), Enter accepts; confirm dialogs also answer to `y`/`n`, select dialogs to `↑`/`↓`, and everything is clickable. A session reload cancels open and queued dialogs, and a dialog pending at shutdown resolves its cancel value.

### Workspace documents

`ctx.workspace` reads full documents from the current review and writes eligible working-tree files.

| Method                                 | Result                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `readDocument(fileId, "old" \| "new")` | Reviewed source text or `null`                    |
| `canWriteDocument(fileId)`             | Whether review policy allows a write              |
| `writeDocument({ fileId, text })`      | `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, reason, detail }` |

```ts
const file = ctx.selection.file;
if (file && ctx.workspace.canWriteDocument(file.id)) {
  const text = await ctx.workspace.readDocument(file.id, "new");
  if (text !== null) {
    await ctx.workspace.writeDocument({ fileId: file.id, text: transform(text) });
  }
}
```

Reads return the source represented by the review, including historical content in revision and stash reviews. Missing, unreadable, or oversized sources return `null`; reads never prompt.

Writes require a reloadable, unstaged working-tree review and a writable reviewed-file id. Hunk verifies the target, asks for attributed consent, verifies it again, writes it, and reloads the review. Other review kinds and deleted, binary, oversized, missing, symlinked, or root-escaping targets return `unavailable`. Cancellation returns `cancelled`; an attempted write failure returns `failed` with a displayable `detail`.

`canWriteDocument` does not inspect the filesystem, so `writeDocument` can still refuse a changed target. See the [full workspace guide](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/extensions.md#workspace-documents) for lifecycle and error details.

## `hunk.on(event, handler)`

Subscribe to a lifecycle or UI event. Handlers may be async; Hunk never blocks the UI waiting for one. Every handler receives `ctx.panes`, live `ctx.navigation`, attributed `ctx.dialogs`, and `ctx.review.requestReload()` alongside `cwd` and `notify`, so a `startup` handler can present one focused welcome dialog and navigate to its first example without a keypress. `ctx.sidebars` is deprecated. Controls retained across a review or extension-registry replacement expire instead of controlling the replacement UI; workspace reads and writes that have not started return `null`/`unavailable`. Once a consented filesystem write starts, it reports its actual outcome, graceful shutdown waits for it, and success reconciles the review then active.

| Event                  | Payload                                              | When                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `startup`              | `{ cwd }`                                            | once, after the app mounts with its first changeset      |
| `changeset_loaded`     | `{ changeset }`                                      | first load and every reload                              |
| `command_executed`     | `{ commandId, canonicalCommandId? }`                 | after a named command dispatches in this terminal host   |
| `selection_changed`    | `{ fileId, hunkIndex }`                              | when the review selection settles (debounced ~150ms)     |

- A newly mounted instance receives `startup` before its first `changeset_loaded`; reloads deliver `changeset_loaded` before `session_reload` after the matching review commits.
- Starting with extension API v23, `layout_changed` adds `canonicalMode` and `canonicalLayout`, which use `"unified"`. The original `mode` and `layout` fields remain available for compatibility and continue to report `"stack"` where their canonical counterparts report `"unified"`. To preserve exhaustive existing source, `ExtensionLayoutMode` and `ExtensionResolvedLayout` retain their pre-v23 shapes; new extensions use `ExtensionCanonicalLayoutMode` and `ExtensionCanonicalResolvedLayout`. Hunk will keep `"stack"` and the legacy fields until a separately announced major API revision.
- `selection_changed` is trailing-debounced: holding `[`/`]` retargets many times a second, and handlers only care where the user landed. `fileId` and `hunkIndex` are `null` when nothing is selected.
- `hunk_viewed` fires when the settled `(file, hunk)` pair changes, including `[`/`]` inside one file. Current-line movement within a hunk does not emit it. `file_viewed` still fires only when the selected file object changes.
- `command_executed` reports stable command ids after terminal dispatch from a key, menu, or `ctx.commands.execute`. For a renamed command, `commandId` preserves the deprecated identity and `canonicalCommandId` names its replacement. Detached async extension work may still be running; the event observes the accepted action rather than promise settlement. It follows remapped keys; browser/session review intents and widget-owned Escape, Enter, note-editor Ctrl-S, and F10 menu navigation are not terminal commands.
- `session_reload`'s `reason` is `"watch"`, `"daemon"` (an agent command through the session broker), `"extension"` (an in-process extension request), or `"manual"`.
- `note_created` and `note_edited` cover notes authored in Hunk's own UI this session. Agent session comments do not emit them, and a reload may remap or drop notes. Use them for incremental reactions.
- `note_changed` is store-backed: `kind` is `"created"`, `"updated"`, or `"removed"`, and `note` matches the snapshot shape command handlers read through `ctx.review.snapshot()`. It includes agent session comments and user deletes; drafts never appear. Reloads that remap notes do not emit it — use `session_reload` to invalidate extension-owned state and read the complete current record from a later command snapshot.
- `shutdown` handlers get 250ms before Hunk exits anyway; treat it as best-effort flushing. UI authority has already been revoked, so shutdown is for releasing extension-owned resources rather than navigation or dialogs.

## `hunk.events`

A small bus shared by every loaded extension, for coordinating without coupling through global state. Namespace event names with your extension id. Delivery is fire-and-forget; events emitted while factories are still loading are queued until every extension has subscribed.

```ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "hunkdiff/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.events.on<{ fileCount: number }>("summary:ready", (payload, ctx) => {
    if (payload.fileCount > 100) ctx.panes.open("summary");
  });

  hunk.on("changeset_loaded", ({ changeset }, ctx) => {
    hunk.events.emit("summary:ready", { fileCount: changeset.files.length });
    ctx.panes.open("summary");
  });
}
```

Bus payloads are shallow-frozen copies when they are objects. Keep nested data immutable if multiple extensions will read it.

## `ctx.review.requestReload()` in event handlers

Request a soft reload after an external agent, service, or process changes the current review's inputs. Hunk preserves mounted UI state and selection where possible, serializes the request with every other reload, and coalesces concurrent extension requests. This does not require `--watch`.

```ts
import type { HunkExtensionAPI } from "hunkdiff/extension";

export default function (hunk: HunkExtensionAPI) {
  hunk.events.on("agent:files-changed", async (_payload, ctx) => {
    const result = await ctx.review.requestReload();
    if (!result.ok) ctx.notify(result.detail, "warning");
  });
}
```

Success resolves `{ ok: true }` after the replacement commits and emits `session_reload` with reason `"extension"`. Non-reloadable inputs and expired controls resolve `unavailable`; started reloads that fail resolve `failed` with a displayable `detail`. Factory-time bus events run before live controls mount, so they cannot request a reload.

Requests made from the successor's lifecycle handlers can schedule a trailing reload. Check `session_reload.reason` before requesting from that event so an extension does not create its own reload loop.

## `hunk.config`

Your extension's own `[extension.<id>]` config table, as a plain object. Hunk does not interpret the keys, and repo config overrides user config key by key.

**Treat these values as untrusted.** A repository under review can set or override the table for an extension you installed globally (deliberate — team-level tuning of a shared extension), so never use `hunk.config` for exec-adjacent decisions such as binary paths, shell commands, or module loading. Validate those against something the user controls.

```toml
# ~/.config/hunk/config.toml
[extension.collapse-generated]
patterns = ["*.lock", "dist/**"]
```

```ts
const patterns = (hunk.config.patterns as string[] | undefined) ?? ["*.lock"];
```

## `ctx.notify(message, type?)`

Every handler and transform receives a context with `cwd` and `notify`; event and bus handlers add `panes`, `review.requestReload`, and `events.emit`, command handlers add `commands`, `panes`, `fileViews`, `selection`, `navigation`, and `dialogs`. `notify` shows one transient line at the bottom of the app; `type` is `"info"` (default), `"warning"`, or `"error"`. Messages raised before the UI mounts are buffered, so a `startup` handler can notify safely.

## `hunk.log(message)`

Record a diagnostic line. Logs are collected per extension rather than written to the terminal, because the TUI owns the screen.

Menu entries, standalone keybindings (chords without a command — `registerCommand` commands are already user-remappable), custom note renderers, and session commands. Generic CLI trees are available through `registerCliCommand`. See the [extension architecture](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/extension-architecture.md) for the current host design. The [original exploration](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/blob/main/docs/extension-system-exploration.md) records historical rationale and phasing.
