        question: "Can I use difftastic as Hunk's diff engine?",
        answer:
          "No. Hunk builds its review stream from unified diffs, and difftastic's output is its own rendered display, or JSON, rather than a patch. Configure difftastic as a Git external diff for the files where structure matters, and use `hunk diff` to review the changeset.",
      },
      {
        question: "Does Hunk do structural or AST diffing?",
        answer:
          "No. Hunk highlights changes at word level within a line and honors Git's `--color-moved` for moved blocks, but it does not parse code into a syntax tree. If you need AST-level diffing, difftastic is the right tool.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which one handles a big refactor better?",
        answer:
          "Depends on the shape of it. For one file that was reformatted or rewrapped, difftastic tells you the truth faster. For a refactor spread across many files, Hunk's review stream plus `--color-moved` is the more workable read, because the problem is tracking thirty files rather than understanding one.",
      },
      {
        question: "Is difftastic slower than Hunk?",
        answer:
          "Hard to compare directly, since one is a diff algorithm and the other is a UI. What is documented is that difftastic's tree diffing gets expensive on files with many changes. Hunk's cost scales with rendering the changeset instead, and the experimental `hunk --fast` offloads eligible syntax highlighting.",

          "The agent-facing part runs the other direction from a comment box. Each session registers with a local loopback daemon, and the agent uses non-interactive `hunk session` commands to inspect the review you are looking at, navigate it, and leave notes. `hunk session review --json` gives it the structure of the changeset without pushing the whole patch into its context. Its reasoning then renders inline as note cards on specific hunks, so the explanation sits next to the code instead of in a separate transcript.",

Plannotator documents SSH and devcontainer setups, auto-detecting SSH and switching to a fixed port you forward, but the reading still happens in a browser on some machine.",
